 2239. Find Closest Number to Zero
 
 Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums.
 If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.
 
 ---
 
 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
 Output: 1
 Explanation:
 The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
 The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
 The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
 The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
 The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
 Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.
 
 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.
